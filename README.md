# AIO - Week 4: Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv10 model. The project utilizes Streamlit for the web interface and OpenCV for image processing.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TungTSon/AIO_Wk4_ObjectDetection.git
   cd AIO_Wk4_ObjectDetection
```

2. **Install required dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit application:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
4. **Upload an image and see the detection results:**

Upload an image using the provided file uploader.
Adjust the confidence threshold slider to filter detections by confidence level.
View the processed image with detected objects highlighted.
